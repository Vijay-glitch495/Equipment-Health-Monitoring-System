## Overview:
This project focuses on predictive maintenance in industrial settings, specifically classifying types of failures based on sensor data. Using Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling, Streamlit to deploy, and CRISP-DM for project organization, we aim to enhance machine reliability and reduce downtime through maintenance strategies.

## Objectives:
Classify types of failures using machine learning models.

## Data Source:
The analysis utilizes the Predictive Maintenance Dataset (AI4I 2020), containing sensor readings and failure information from industrial equipment.

<li>Jupyter Notebook: Contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.</li>
<li>CRISP-DM Framework: Organizes the project into phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.</li>
<li>Streamlit App: Deploys the trained model for interactive predictions and analysis.</li> 

## Technologies Used
<li>Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
<li>NumPy: For numerical operations.</li>
<li>Matplotlib: For data visualization.</li>

<li>Feature Importance: Analyzed which features had the most impact on predictions to improve model interpretability.</li>

## 6. Deployment
<li>Saving the Model:  Used pickle to save the trained model for future use.</li>
<li>Creating a Web Interface: Implemented a web application using Streamlit to allow users to make predictions interactively.</li>

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work
<li>Summary of Results: In this project, I applied classification algorithms to interpret and categorize equipment data, specifically focusing on identifying failure types or indicating whether a failure occurred. I developed a model capable of accurately classifying the type of failure in a specific process or determining if a failure occurred. This approach aids in post-analysis and decision-making, allowing for a better understanding of equipment performance and maintenance needs.</li>

<li> The application of machine learning techniques in this project demonstrates my practical experience in data analysis and classification modeling. While the model doesn't predict or preemptively anticipate failures, it effectively interprets data patterns to categorize equipment performance outcomes. This experience showcases my ability to apply data science methodologies to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, contributing to proactive maintenance strategies and operational efficiency improvements.</li>
<li>Future Enhancements: To improve system performance, more diverse data is needed, and exploring deep learning models could provide better predictive accuracy and robustness.</li>
